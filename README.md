# Bidirectional-Maze-Search

Solving a maze using Bi-directional search that uses BFS on both the sides.

This algorithm takes input as a text file that is a matrix of 0's and 1's. "0" represents the path that can be traversed and "1" represents walls (can't traverse through it). So, the Open routes are a sequence of 0's. The entrance is top-left and exit is bottom-right. The output is a text file that contains only 0, 1, and 2 values. It is the same content as the input file except that the discvered path is marked with 2. The output file name is "OutputMaze.txt".
